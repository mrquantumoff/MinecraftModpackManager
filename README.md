# Minecraft modpack manager

# DEPRECATED: Please do not submit any new PRs here. Instead submit them to the [flutter rewrite of the project](https://github.com/mrquantumoff/mcmodpackmanager_reborn). This repository will be archived as soon as I will finalize the flutter rewrite of the project.

### Note: On GNU+Linux I highly recommend using flatpak binaries
## Installation (not recommended, better wait for the Flathub/Microsoft Store release of the rewrite)
* Download the latest binary from the [releases tab](https://github.com/mrquantumoff/mcmodpackmanager_reborn/releases/latest)
* Open it
* Do the common installation process for your os



## [Available on Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/dev.mrquantumoff.mcmodpackmanager)

Other info is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/mrquantumoff/mcmodpackmanager_reborn/wiki)

## Warning: this app will remove any installed mods after first time of applying/clearing modpacks
